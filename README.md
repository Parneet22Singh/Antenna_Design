# Antenna_Design
# ðŸ“¡ Antenna Dimension Calculator

A Python tool to calculate patch antenna dimensions based on user-selected material and target frequency. Automatically computes substrate height using permittivity and frequency.

## Features
- Recommends appropriate material for each component
- Select material from CST database
- Auto-calculates substrate height
- Computes patch length and width
- Displays material properties

## How to Use
1. Run `main.py`
2. Select material number
3. Enter frequency in GHz
4. Enter substrate height in mm

## Requirements
- pandas
- math
Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install pandas
