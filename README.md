A Streamlit-based Python tool that calculates microstrip patch antenna dimensions based on user-defined operating frequency, substrate height, and material selection. The app supports two modes â€” a free-form calculator and a design-oriented mode with material restrictions per antenna component.

## Features
- Calculates patch length, width, ground plane dimensions, and feed point location  
- Select substrate and conductor materials from a CST Studio Suite extracted database  
- Supports two modes:  
  - **Standard Patch Calculator Mode:** Full freedom in substrate material selection  
  - **Design-Oriented Mode:** Material selection restricted by component type (substrate, patch, ground)  
- Displays material properties such as relative permittivity (Îµr), loss tangent (tanÎ´), and conductivity (Ïƒ)  
- Visualizes antenna geometry in 2D (Matplotlib) and 3D (Plotly)  

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository and navigate to its folder:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Parneet22Singh/Antenna_Design.git
   cd Antenna_Design
## Install required dependencies:

- pip install streamlit pandas matplotlib plotly

## Run the app:

-streamlit run main.py
- Choose the calculation mode, select materials, input design parameters, and calculate antenna dimensions.

## Dataset
-The materials dataset (cst_materials_extracted.csv) is generated by parsing .mtd files from the Materials folder inside CST Studio Suite. -It contains essential material properties such as relative permittivity (Îµr), loss tangent (tanÎ´), and conductivity (Ïƒ).

## Note:
- Some dataset entries have "N.A." for fields not used in this project. Handle these carefully when processing numerical data.
- A script parse.py is available for extracting a full dataset from CST .mtd files if you need more detailed material data.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
